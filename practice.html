    <section id="volcanoes">
      <h2>Volcanoes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mt. Washburn is a stratovolcano that post-dates the last caldera-forming eruption at Yellowstone.</li>
        <li>Volcanic arcs are associated with subduction zones.</li>
        <li>Shield volcanoes are mostly constructed of basaltic flows.</li>
        <li>Andesite is an igneous volcanic rock.</li>
        <li>Which type of volcano is made of interbedded lava flows and pyroclastic deposits? Stratovolcano</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="igneous-rocks">
      <h2>Igneous Rocks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is formed when magma crystallizes slowly underground? Coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock.</li>
        <li>The grain size of an igneous rock imparts important information about cooling rate.</li>
        <li>Mafic silicate minerals containing iron tend to weather primarily by oxidation.</li>
        <li>Peridotite has the least amount of silica content among rock types.</li>
        <li>Fractional crystallization involves the separation of crystals and melt during cooling.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="sedimentary-rocks">
      <h2>Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Coarser-grained sediments are usually closer to their original sources and deposited in higher-energy environments.</li>
        <li>Which type of sediment settles from water flowing at the highest velocity? Gravel.</li>
        <li>The mineral or material most resistant to weathering is quartz.</li>
        <li>Stream beds upstream of dams experience more silting, while stream beds downstream experience more erosion.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="metamorphic-rocks">
      <h2>Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Which type of rock is formed by recrystallization at elevated temperature and pressure? Metamorphic.</li>
        <li>The protolith of schist is shale.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="earth-structure">
      <h2>Earth's Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Volumetrically, the Earth is mostly silicate rock.</li>
        <li>The Earth's inner core is composed of solid iron-nickel, while the outer core is liquid.</li>
        <li>Slow convection of solid rock occurs in the Earth's deep mantle.</li>
        <li>What is the composition of the Earth's inner core? Solid iron-nickel.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="plate-tectonics">
      <h2>Plate Tectonics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Regions of the seafloor with negative magnetic anomalies were formed during times when the Earth's magnetic field had reversed polarity.</li>
        <li>The last major supercontinent was named Pangea and broke apart approximately 200 million years ago.</li>
        <li>When two segments of oceanic lithosphere converge, the older segment will get subducted.</li>
        <li>The San Andreas Fault is located along a transform plate boundary.</li>
        <li>The Pacific Plate is moving to the northwest, as evidenced by the Hawaiian Island chain.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="coastal-erosion">
      <h2>Coastal Erosion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>According to Orrin Pilkey, seawalls cause erosion and steepening of the shoreface in front of the wall.</li>
        <li>The best long-term response to coastal erosion along developed shorelines is the relocation of buildings.</li>
        <li>Barrier islands are moving towards the mainland, exposing older mud deposits on their seaward side.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="dating-methods">
      <h2>Dating Methods</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using radioactive isotopes to date rocks is the basis of absolute dating.</li>
        <li>Index fossils are found over a wide area and existed during a relatively short period of geologic time.</li>
        <li>Which of the following materials could be dated with the Carbon-14 dating technique? A piece of wood ~2000 years old.</li>
      </ul>
