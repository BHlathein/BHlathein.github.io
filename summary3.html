          <h2>Glaciers</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How do glaciers form?</strong> Glaciers form from the accumulation of snow, which compacts and turns into ice over time due to pressure. The ice then begins to flow under its own weight.</li>
            <li><strong>What are the two main types of glaciers?</strong> The two main types of glaciers are alpine glaciers, which form in mountain ranges, and continental glaciers, which cover vast areas of land like ice sheets.</li>
            <li><strong>What were the Pleistocene Ice Ages?</strong> The Pleistocene Ice Ages were a series of glaciations that occurred during the Quaternary period, leading to the formation of large ice sheets and major climatic changes.</li>
            <li><strong>What are three astronomical cycles (“Milankovitch cycles”) that control global climate, and hence major ice ages?</strong> The three Milankovitch cycles are axial tilt, eccentricity, and precession, which affect Earth's climate by changing the amount and distribution of solar energy reaching Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>What are the processes contributing to accumulation and ablation of glaciers?</strong> Accumulation occurs when snow and ice build up in a glacier, while ablation involves the melting, sublimation, or calving of ice from the glacier.</li>
            <li><strong>What happens to a glacier for which accumulation > ablation? accumulation < ablation? accumulation = ablation?</strong> If accumulation exceeds ablation, the glacier advances. If ablation exceeds accumulation, the glacier retreats. If accumulation equals ablation, the glacier remains stationary.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern glaciers: are they advancing, retreating, or stationary?</strong> Most modern glaciers are retreating due to global warming, although some are stationary or advancing in specific regions.</li>
            <li><strong>What are two processes of glacial erosion? What evidences of these processes are left behind in glaciated regions?</strong> The two main processes of glacial erosion are abrasion (scraping of the bedrock by ice) and plucking (lifting of rocks from the bed). Evidence includes striations and polished rock surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Be able to define, sketch, or identify from photos or diagrams the following features related to alpine glaciation: U-shaped valley, cirque, arête, horn, hanging valley.</strong> U-shaped valleys are formed by glaciers cutting through river valleys, cirques are amphitheater-like hollows at the head of glaciers, arêtes are sharp ridges between valleys, horns are pointed peaks formed by erosion, and hanging valleys are elevated valleys formed by tributary glaciers.</li>
            <li><strong>How are glacial till, outwash deposits (including eskers), and drumlins different in terms of their origin?</strong> Glacial till is unsorted sediment deposited directly by the glacier, outwash deposits are sorted by meltwater, and drumlins are elongated hills formed by ice-flow reshaping glacial debris.</li>
            <li><strong>Be able to define, sketch, or identify from photos or diagrams the following features related to glacial deposits: till, glacial erratic, end moraine, lateral moraine, medial moraine, esker, and drumlin.</strong> Till is unsorted sediment, glacial erratics are boulders transported by glaciers, end moraines mark the furthest advance of a glacier, lateral moraines form along the sides, medial moraines form where two glaciers meet, eskers are winding ridges of sediment deposited by meltwater, and drumlins are smooth, elongated hills of glacial debris.</li>
            <li><strong>Where are some regionally-extensive end moraines located in North America?</strong> Major end moraines are found in the northeastern United States, including the Long Island and Cape Cod moraines, marking the furthest advance of glaciers during the last Ice Age.</li>

          <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How is the mechanical behavior of rock similar to that of a rubber band? Be able to describe the elastic rebound theory of earthquakes.</strong> Rocks deform under stress like a rubber band, but when the stress exceeds the strength of the rock, it breaks and rebounds, causing an earthquake.</li>
            <li><strong>Know terminology related to earthquakes: epicenter, focus, fault plane, scarp.</strong> The epicenter is the point on the Earth's surface above the earthquake's origin (focus), which occurs along a fault plane, often creating a scarp (step-like feature on the surface).</li>
            <li><strong>What are the four types of seismic waves? What are their relative velocities and motions?</strong> The four types of seismic waves are Primary (P) waves (fastest, compressional motion), Secondary (S) waves (slower, shear motion), Love waves (surface waves, horizontal motion), and Rayleigh waves (surface waves, rolling motion).</li>
            <li><strong>How does surficial geology affect the intensity of surface waves? How was this important during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the Bay Area of California?</strong> Surficial geology affects the amplification of seismic waves; softer sediments can amplify waves, as seen in the Bay Area, where soft sediments increased the shaking during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</li>
            <li><strong>How does a modern seismograph work? Why are multiple instruments needed to completely record the location of an earthquake?</strong> A seismograph records ground motion, and multiple instruments are needed to triangulate the epicenter by measuring the time difference between P and S wave arrivals.</li>
            <li><strong>What kind of observations is the Mercalli intensity scale based on?</strong> The Mercalli intensity scale is based on human observations of earthquake effects, such as building damage and the movement of people and objects.</li>
            <li><strong>How many seismic stations are needed to locate an earthquake epicenter?</strong> At least three seismic stations are needed to triangulate the earthquake's epicenter.</li>
            <li><strong>How is the Richter magnitude determined for an earthquake? How is it different from the Mercalli intensity?</strong> The Richter magnitude is calculated based on the amplitude of seismic waves, whereas the Mercalli intensity is based on observed effects at specific locations.</li>
            <li><strong>How is the moment magnitude different from Richter magnitude?</strong> The moment magnitude is based on the energy released by an earthquake, considering the area of fault rupture and displacement, while the Richter scale measures wave amplitude.</li>

          <h2>Crustal Deformation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What is stress (in geology)?</strong> Stress in geology refers to the force per unit area exerted on rocks, causing deformation.</li>
            <li><strong>What are the various types of stress? Which kinds of stress cause deformation (strain)? Which kind causes small changes in volume, but does not deform rocks?</strong> The three types of stress are compressional, tensional, and shear stress. Compressional and tensional stresses cause deformation, while volumetric stress causes small changes in volume.</li>
            <li><strong>What is the difference between brittle and ductile deformation: what variable controls which kind occurs?</strong> Brittle deformation occurs when rocks break, while ductile deformation involves rocks bending. Temperature and pressure control which type occurs.</li>
            <li><strong>What is the difference between a joint and a fault?</strong> A joint is a crack in rock with no movement, while a fault is a crack along which movement has occurred.</li>
            <li><strong>What are the three types of faults, and how are they related to the three types of directed stress?</strong> The three types of faults are normal (tensional stress), reverse (compressional stress), and strike-slip (shear stress).</li>
            <li><strong>What is meant by the “hanging wall” and the “footwall” of a fault?</strong> The hanging wall is the block above the fault plane, and the footwall is the block below the fault plane.</li>
            <li><strong>Be able to identify fault types from diagrams or photos.</strong> Normal faults have the hanging wall drop down, reverse faults have the hanging wall move up, and strike-slip faults involve horizontal movement.</li>
            <li><strong>What are the various kinds of ductile deformation that we discussed in class, and what kind of stress causes them?</strong> Ductile deformation types include folding (caused by compressional stress) and flow (caused by shear stress).</li>
            <li><strong>Be able to distinguish between a syncline, anticline, monocline, dome, and basin, either from photos or diagrams.</strong> Synclines are downfolds, anticlines are upfolds, monoclines are simple bends, domes are uplifted areas, and basins are sunken areas.</li>

          <h2>Earth's Interior</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What are some direct and indirect methods used to study the Earth's deep structure?</strong> Direct methods include drilling, while indirect methods include seismic wave analysis and studying magnetic and gravitational fields.</li>
            <li><strong>What are the most abundant chemical elements in the Earth?</strong> The most abundant elements in the Earth are oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium.</li>
            <li><strong>What are some physical properties, thicknesses, and compositional/mineralogical characteristics of the various regions of the Earth?</strong> The Earth's layers include the crust (solid, thin, silicate), mantle (semi-rigid, silicate), outer core (liquid, iron-nickel), and inner core (solid, iron-nickel).</li>
            <li><strong>What probably causes the seismic discontinuities at 400 and 670 km depth?</strong> These discontinuities are likely caused by changes in mineral composition and phase transitions in the mantle.</li>
            <li><strong>Where is the mantle partially molten?</strong> The mantle is partially molten in the asthenosphere, located just below the lithosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>What are some major differences (age, composition, density, thickness, mechanical behavior, etc.) between the crust and mantle? between continental crust and oceanic crust? between the asthenosphere and lithosphere?</strong> The crust is thinner, lighter, and less dense than the mantle. Continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust. The lithosphere is rigid, while the asthenosphere is partially molten and flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Which layer(s) are convecting? fairly rigid?</strong> The mantle is convecting, while the lithosphere is rigid.</li>
            <li><strong>What is the principle of isostasy and how does it explain the deep structure of mountains?</strong> Isostasy is the balance between the Earth's lithosphere floating on the denser, more fluid asthenosphere. It explains why mountains have deep crustal roots.</li>
            <li><strong>How do we know that mountains have deep crustal roots?</strong> Studies of seismic waves show that mountains have thicker crust beneath them due to isostatic equilibrium.</li>

          <h2>The Discovery of Plate Tectonics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What evidence did Wegener use to support his theory of continental drift?</strong> Wegener used fossil evidence, geological similarities, and the fit of continental coastlines as evidence for continental drift.</li>
            <li><strong>Why wasn't his theory accepted soon after he presented it?</strong> Wegener's theory lacked a mechanism to explain how continents could move.</li>
            <li><strong>What were some of the oceanographic discoveries that helped resurrect Wegener's theory during the mid-20th century?</strong> Discoveries such as seafloor spreading, paleomagnetism, and oceanic ridges helped support Wegener's theory.</li>
            <li><strong>What is paleomagnetism? How do igneous rocks become magnetized?</strong> Paleomagnetism is the study of ancient magnetic fields recorded in rocks. Igneous rocks become magnetized as they cool and align with Earth's magnetic field.</li>
            <li><strong>How is the Earth's magnetic field generated? What is believed to cause reversals of the Earth's magnetic field?</strong> The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of molten iron in the outer core. Reversals are thought to occur due to changes in the fluid dynamics of the core.</li>
            <li><strong>How are studies of volcanic rocks on land used to construct the geomagnetic reversal time scale?</strong> Studies of volcanic rocks record the history of Earth's magnetic field reversals, allowing scientists to construct the geomagnetic reversal time scale.</li>
            <li><strong>How are magnetic anomalies used to date the ocean floor?</strong> Magnetic anomalies in oceanic crust help determine the age of the floor based on the pattern of normal and reversed magnetic stripes.</li>
            <li><strong>Where are the youngest portions of the ocean floor located? the oldest?</strong> The youngest oceanic crust is found at mid-ocean ridges, while the oldest is found near continental margins.</li>
            <li><strong>Why is there no oceanic crust around today older than ~200 million years?</strong> Oceanic crust is continually being recycled at subduction zones, so no oceanic crust older than 200 million years remains.</li>

          <h2>Plate Tectonics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Approximately how many lithospheric plates are there, and how do we know where their boundaries are located?</strong> There are approximately 12 major lithospheric plates, and their boundaries are identified through seismic activity, magnetic anomalies, and geological features.</li>
            <li><strong>What is the difference between an active and a passive continental margin? For your own study, be able to sketch a simplified passive margin.</strong> Active continental margins are associated with plate boundaries, while passive margins are not. A simplified passive margin consists of a continental shelf, slope, and rise.</li>
            <li><strong>For all three types of plate margins...</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Be able to identify important features associated with a particular type of plate margin.</li>
                <li>Be able to describe the geologic activity at a particular type of plate margin.</li>
                <li>Be able to list some geographic examples of a particular type of plate margin.</li>
                <li>Be able to sketch and label a simplified cross-section through a mid-ocean ridge and a continental margin subduction zone.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What happens to oceanic lithosphere as it ages?</strong> As oceanic lithosphere ages, it becomes denser and sinks deeper into the mantle.</li>
            <li><strong>Why are volcanoes only present on one side of a convergent boundary subduction zone? What processes are believed to cause this magmatic activity?</strong> Volcanoes are typically only present on one side of a subduction zone due to the subduction of oceanic lithosphere, which melts and forms magma.</li>
            <li><strong>What happens when various kinds of crust (continental or oceanic) collide with each other? What are the geologic results of these collisions?</strong> Continental crust collisions form mountain ranges, while oceanic-continental and oceanic-oceanic collisions form subduction zones, leading to volcanism and deep ocean trenches.</li>
            <li><strong>How do oceanic fracture zones work? Where along their length does active faulting occur?</strong> Oceanic fracture zones are areas of horizontal displacement on the seafloor, with active faulting occurring along their lengths at transform plate boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>What are some general geologic characteristics of plate interiors?</strong> Plate interiors are typically more geologically stable and feature old, thick continental crust.</li>
            <li><strong>What are mantle plumes and hotspots, how are they thought to originate, how do they produce volcanism in otherwise geologically-boring places like plate interiors, and what are a few geographic examples?</strong> Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant rock rising from the mantle, creating hotspots that produce volcanoes in plate interiors, such as the Hawaiian Islands and Yellowstone.</li>
